# Medium backend clone

Implementing the [Realworld Medium Clone Specifications](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/implementation-creation/features) using TypeORM/Postgres and Hexagonal Architecture.

## Quick Start with Logging

To set up Loki and Grafana for logging:

**Prerequisites:**

- PostgreSQL database must be running externally
- Configure database connection in your `.env` file

```bash
# Start Loki and Grafana services
./scripts/start-with-logging.sh

# Or manually
docker-compose up -d
```

**Then start your API server:**

```bash
# Option 1: Use the helper script (checks Loki is running)
./scripts/start-api.sh

# Option 2: Start directly
npm run start:dev
```

**Access Points:**

- üåê **API**: http://localhost:3000 (when running locally)
- üìä **Grafana Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
- üîç **Loki API**: http://localhost:3100

**View Logs:**

1. Open Grafana at http://localhost:3001
2. Login with admin/admin
3. Navigate to "API Logs Dashboard" for pre-configured views
4. Or use "Explore" for custom LogQL queries

## Roadmap

1. **Add Clap Feature for Articles**

   - **Database**: Add a `clap` table with the following columns: `id`, `article_id` (foreign key), `user_id` (foreign key), and `counter`, with a composite primary key on `article_id` and `user_id`.
   - **API to Clap an Article**: Create an API endpoint that allows users to clap for an article. Each clap will increment the counter associated with the user and article.
   - **Get Articles API Update**: Modify the existing "get articles" API to include the total clap count for each article, aggregating claps from all users.
